FROM 15 MAY 2025 TO 23 OCTOBER 2025 17:00 CEST
Eureka is the world's biggest public network for international cooperation in R&D and
innovation, present in over 45 countries. It is a decentralised intergovernmental organisation
aiming to boost the productivity and competitiveness of industries by funding and supporting
international collaborative market-driven R&D projects.
This call for projects is launched following Eureka's Network projects framework based on
mutual consent between participating national and regional funding bodies.
The national funding bodies (NFB) from Austria, Belgium (Flanders & Wallonia), Chile, France,
Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Türkiye and Ukraine have
allocated funding for organisations collaborating on international R&D projects in the field of
Lightweighting.
You can submit your R&D project application concerning Lightweighting for this call for projects
between 15 May 2024 and 23 October 2025 17:00 CEST. Your project consortium must include
organisations based in a minimum of two of the countries/regions listed in this call.
Eureka programme: Network projects
Participating countries/regions
Austria, Belgium (Flanders & Wallonia), Chile, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland,
Portugal, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Türkiye and Ukraine
Scope
This project call is for R&D projects within Lightweighting technologies.
Lightweighting technology is a key enabling technology to reduce weight, save materials, and
improve functionality while maintaining or enhancing performance. Smart lightweight design,
advanced materials, and optimised manufacturing processes are crucial parameters. Digital
solutions for calculation models, production processes, and performance evaluation are
essential tools for driving innovation in lightweighting. Lightweighting technology provides
environmentally friendly solutions while simultaneously adding commercial value across
multiple industries.
Effects targeted by lightweighting technologies include:
A. Optimisation of resource and energy efficiency
Smart lightweight design helps to reduce material and energy consumption during the
manufacturing and use phase of new materials and products. Increasing the duration of
use and lifespan of lightweight materials and products by wear reduction, slowing down
the aging process, and improving material fatigue contributes to resource and energy
efficiency. Structural health monitoring of existing and new components indicates when
repair or replacement is necessary, further contributing to resource efficiency. The use
of simulations, virtual models (digital twin), intelligent process control (machine
learning), and automation allows predictive manufacturing, reductions in time-to-
1market, processing times, and material waste from substandard products, significantly
reducing environmental impact and CO2 emissions.
B. Maximising efficiency and performance
Lightweighting enables not only weight reduction but also optimised material use and
structural principles for maximum efficiency and performance. The challenge is to
develop and implement advanced lightweighting technologies that enable load-
optimised material usage while maintaining or improving functionality. This requires
integrating digital solutions such as simulations, virtual models (digital twins), and
intelligent process control to enhance flexibility and adaptability in lightweight design.
Modern manufacturing methods, including additive manufacturing, open new
possibilities for application-specific production. To fully unlock the potential of
lightweighting, innovative approaches in material selection, shaping, and production
must be explored to create economic value.
C. Bolstering lightweight advancements in mobility and integration in more areas
The mobility sector remains a core focus for lightweighting advancements due to its
high potential for efficiency gains and environmental impact reduction. Further
improvements in lightweight materials, structures, and manufacturing techniques are
essential for achieving enhanced fuel efficiency and sustainability in automotive,
aerospace, railway, and maritime applications. At the same time, expanding lightweight
solutions beyond mobility to other sectors can unlock additional benefits.
Standardisation of new lightweight materials, technologies, measuring and testing
methods, the development of digital twins, interconnected production processes, and
accessible databases on lightweight materials encourage the transfer and development
of new lightweight technologies across industries.
Relevant industry sectors include (but are not limited to):
Regardless of national priorities, all sectors with a need for lightweighting technologies are
welcome, including but not limited to automotive, railway, aerospace, space, maritime,
mechanical engineering, energy, construction, infrastructure, health, farming, and forestry, etc.
Call-relevant lightweighting technologies to be researched and developed include (but are not
limited to):
